# iDNS

isDNS/iDNS (InterStellar Domain Name System)

Very important component

## Purpose

Indexing content on planets/objects/space stations that you are receiving data from, then you can choose which one to connect to

EG: 

Note: these times are all made up, except for the moon, that is how long it takes to go from the Earth to its moon at light speed

```
International Space Station (Earth) - - - ETA: 119 milliseconds [connect] [<IP_Address>]

Moon (Earth) - - - ETA: 1.3 seconds [connect] [<IP_Address>]

Option 2 (Mars) - - - ETA: 4 minutes 5.0 seconds [connect] [<IP_Address>]

Space Ship v848s7eusjsjd8vejs7nejri - - - ETA: 4 minutes 35.181 seconds [connect] [<IP_Address>]
```

These inter range connections should be stored on a database at least 0.2 light seconds from the user, it shouldn't take longer than 1 second total. Copies of the database should be updated and refreshed automatically at least once per hour
